# Handy Tools
Small useful programs that you feel like you should already have. See files for detailed usage information.

I found that I use these tools surprisingly often, so I decided to open-source them to everybody. If you find these useful, consider starring this repo or [buying me a cup of coffee](https://cash.me/$anuragbanerjee). Pull requests are welcome.
