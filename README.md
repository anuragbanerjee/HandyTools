# Handy Tools
Small useful programs that you feel like you should already have. See files for detailed usage information.

I found that I use these tools surprisingly often, so I decided to open-source them to everybody. If you find these useful, consider starring this repo or [buying me a cup of coffee](https://cash.me/$anuragbanerjee). Pull requests are welcome.

## Programs

1. **[Batch Rename Extensions](batch-rename-extensions.py)**
2. **[Batch Rename Filename](batch-rename-filenames.py)**
3. **[CSV to JSON Converter](csv-to-json.py)**
4. **[JSON to CSV Converter](json-to-csv.py)**
5. **[Quick Add for Google Calendar](quick-add/quick-add.py)** (also as an Alfred extension in folder)
6. **[Roman Numerals](roman-numerals.py)**
